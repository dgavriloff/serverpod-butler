# Breakout Butler

## What It Is

**Breakout Butler** is a Zoom companion web app that creates collaborative workspaces for breakout room sessions. It solves the universal classroom problem: *"Wait, what did the professor want us to do?"*

When a professor sends students into Zoom breakout rooms, they lose the ability to hear instructions, ask clarifying questions, or see what other groups are discussing. Breakout Butler bridges this gap with:

- **Live Transcription** — The professor's voice is transcribed in real-time and streamed to all rooms
- **AI Butler** — Students can ask "What did she say about X?" and get instant answers based on the transcript
- **Collaborative Workspaces** — Each room gets a shared text editor AND freehand drawing canvas that sync in real-time
- **Professor Dashboard** — See all rooms at once, monitor activity, and synthesize insights across groups
- **AI Assignment Extraction** — Professor can auto-generate assignment prompts from lecture transcript

## The Problem

In remote/hybrid education:
1. Students in breakout rooms can't hear ongoing instructions
2. Professors can't easily monitor what groups are working on
3. There's no way to capture cross-room insights or compare group work
4. Students forget the assignment the moment they enter their room

## The Solution

Breakout Butler acts as a digital teaching assistant that:
- Captures everything the professor says
- Makes it searchable and queryable via AI
- Provides real-time collaborative workspaces
- Gives professors a bird's-eye view of all rooms
- Synthesizes themes and contradictions across groups

## Target Users

- **Professors/Instructors** running discussion-based classes with breakout rooms
- **Students** participating in group activities who need context
- **Workshop facilitators** managing multiple breakout groups
- **Corporate trainers** running interactive sessions

## Key Differentiators

1. **Real-time, not post-hoc** — Transcription and Q&A happen live, not after class
2. **Room-aware** — Students see their room's work; professors see everything
3. **AI-native** — Butler isn't just search; it understands context and answers questions
4. **Zero friction** — No accounts, no downloads, just a URL and room number
