# Breakout Butler Demo Script

## Recommended Demo Setup

**Option: Pre-loaded Demo (Recommended for 3-min video)**

Pre-load transcript content so you can immediately show the AI features without waiting for live transcription. Here's why:
- Recording → transcription takes real time
- Judges want to see features, not waiting
- You can always do a quick "and here's live recording..." at the end

### Pre-Demo Preparation

1. **Create a fresh session** with a memorable topic (e.g., "Milgram Experiment Discussion")
2. **Pre-load transcript** via the transcript text box on professor dashboard
3. **Set the prompt** (assignment for students)
4. **Have 2 browser windows ready:**
   - Professor dashboard (one tab)
   - Student room (incognito or different browser)

### Suggested Pre-loaded Transcript

```
Today we're discussing the Milgram obedience experiments from 1961. Stanley Milgram wanted to understand how ordinary people could commit atrocities during the Holocaust. The experiment involved participants believing they were administering electric shocks to learners. The key finding was that 65% of participants administered what they believed to be lethal shocks when instructed by an authority figure.

For your breakout discussion, I want each group to consider: Was this experiment ethical? What does it tell us about human nature? And critically, could this happen today with social media and algorithmic authority?

You have 15 minutes. Document your group's position in the shared workspace. I'll synthesize insights across all groups when we reconvene.
```

### Suggested Prompt

```
Discuss whether Milgram's obedience experiment was ethical and what it reveals about authority and conformity. Consider modern parallels.
```

## Demo Script (3 minutes)

### Opening (0:00 - 0:20)
**[Show home screen]**

"This is Breakout Butler — a companion app for Zoom breakout rooms. It solves a universal problem: when students enter breakout rooms, they immediately forget what they're supposed to do and can't hear ongoing instructions."

### Professor Flow (0:20 - 1:00)
**[Click "Create New Session"]**

"As a professor, I create a session — let's call it 'Milgram Discussion' with 3 breakout rooms."

**[Enter session name, room count, click create]**

"I get a dashboard showing all my rooms. I can set the assignment prompt here..."

**[Type or show pre-loaded prompt]**

"Or I can click 'pull from transcript' to have the AI automatically extract the assignment from what I said."

**[Click pull from transcript button if transcript exists]**

"As I lecture, my voice is transcribed in real-time using Gemini 2.0 Flash."

**[Click "rec" button briefly to show recording indicator, or show pre-loaded transcript]**

"Students in any room can see this transcript and ask the AI Butler questions."

### Student Flow (1:00 - 1:50)
**[Switch to student browser/window]**

"Students join by entering the room name and their breakout room number — matching their Zoom assignment."

**[Show student room view]**

"They see a collaborative workspace on the left where the whole group can type together in real-time."

**[Toggle to draw mode, draw a quick sketch]**

"They can also switch to draw mode for diagrams and visual collaboration — great for brainstorming or explaining concepts."

**[Toggle back to write mode]**

"On the right, they have the professor's instructions AND the live transcript."

**[Click on "scribe" tab to show transcript]**

"If a student missed something or joins late, they can ask the Butler..."

**[Type question: "What percentage of participants gave lethal shocks?"]**

"...and get an instant answer based on the lecture transcript."

**[Show Butler response]**

### Real-Time Collaboration (1:50 - 2:15)
**[Type something in student workspace]**

"Everything syncs in real-time via Serverpod streaming endpoints. If I type here..."

**[Switch to professor dashboard, show rooms tab]**

"...the professor sees it instantly on their dashboard. They can monitor all rooms at once without interrupting."

### Professor Synthesis (2:15 - 2:45)
**[Click "synthesize" button]**

"At the end of the session, the professor can synthesize insights across ALL rooms. The AI identifies common themes, contradictions, and notable insights — turning breakout chaos into structured feedback."

**[Show synthesis result]**

### Closing (2:45 - 3:00)
"Breakout Butler: real-time collaboration, live transcription, and an AI assistant that ensures no student ever has to ask 'wait, what are we supposed to do?'"

**[Show home screen with tagline]**

## Demo Tips

1. **Use two browsers** — Chrome for professor, Safari/Firefox/incognito for student
2. **Pre-size windows** — Have them ready side-by-side or use window management
3. **Rehearse the Butler question** — Pick one that has a clear answer in the transcript
4. **Test mic permissions** — If showing live recording, ensure browser has mic access
5. **Have fallback transcript** — If live recording fails, paste the pre-loaded content
6. **Keep it snappy** — 3 minutes goes fast; don't dwell on typing

---

## Alternative: Fully Live Demo

If you want to show everything live:

1. Create session at start
2. Start recording immediately
3. Speak a few sentences about a topic
4. Stop recording
5. Switch to student view
6. Show transcript appeared
7. Ask Butler a question about what you said

**Risk:** Network latency, transcription errors, Gemini API delays. Have a backup plan.
